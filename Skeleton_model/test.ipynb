Map (starmap)

Multiple tasks at once, transform iterable in list (can be memory intensive), blocks program execution until all tasks are completed. Obs.: We also have the starmap function that works the same as map, but support multiple arguments as a tuple, for example starmap(f,[(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)])

Imap

Multiple tasks at once, does not transform iterable in list (pass one argument at a time to each process), does not block program execution, but blocks until the task is completed at the order it was issued (see imap_unordered below to understand the difference with imap_unordered)

Map async (starmap_async)

Multiple tasks at once, transform iterable in list (can be memory intensive), does not block until all tasks are completed, but can only be accessed once all tasks are completed. Obs.: As starmap, we also have starmap_async

Imap unordered

Multiple tasks at once, does not transform iterable in list (pass one argument at a time to each process), does not block program execution, yield results as soon as they are ready, which can be out of order!

In [9]:

def f(x):

    print(f'x = {x}, time is {time.time()} s')

    if x % 2 == 0:

        wait = 1

    else:

        wait = 3
